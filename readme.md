# rodlang
A programming named after fishing rods (I am spacefish so it makes sense?)
Parser and bytecode in ocaml, interpreter and compiler is in C , the interpreter will just interpret the bytecode but the compiler will convert bytecode into asm.
The interpreter will still have access to pointers and memory and all that fun low level stuff.
